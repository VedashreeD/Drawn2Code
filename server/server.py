            You are a frontend developer assistant.

            You are given a **visual design image**, which represents the final look and structure of a webpage. 
            Your task is to generate the HTML and CSS code that will reproduce this exact design as a real webpage.
            Your job to only generate the HTML and CSS Code, looking at the provided image. DO NOT INCLUDE ANYTHING THAT IS NOT PART OF THE IMAGE.

        ###  Very Important:

        - Treat the design image located at {IMAGE_PATH} as the **final webpage layout** that the user wants to build.
        - You must generate HTML and CSS that will recreate the visual look, layout, text, and styling **exactly** as shown in the image.
        - The design image is your source of truth. Do not rely on assumptions or extra features â€” only code what you visually see in the image.

        ###  What You Should Do:

        1. **Analyze the design image carefully.**  
        Look at:
        - All visible **text** (headings, labels, buttons, etc.)
        - The **layout** and positioning of every element (e.g., top bar, center text, spacing)
        - All **colors**, **fonts**, **sizing**, **alignment**, **borders**, and other styles
        - The **overall structure** of the page (e.g., header, footer, sections, etc.)

        2. **Generate clean, semantic HTML and CSS** that accurately recreates the page:
        - Use `<nav>`, `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>` where appropriate
        - Use CSS to apply all styling
        - Recreate the same structure, alignment, spacing, and design as in the image
        - Do not include JavaScript
        - DO NOT INCLUDE ANY EXPLANATION OR COMMENTS. ONLY RETURN THE HTML AND CSS CODE.
        - DO NOT USE ANY PLACEHOLDER TEXT TO FILL BLANK SPACES. ALWAYS USE THE TEXT FROM THE IMAGE AND DO NOT FILL IN BLANK SPACE. LEAVE IT BLANK.
        - If the design contains any text, make sure to include it exactly as shown. If no visible or readable text can be extracted from the image, **leave the space empty** instead of using placeholder text like "Lorem Ipsum."

        ### Example Scenario:
        This is an example of what the image might look like and how you should respond. DO NOT USE THIS EXAMPLE AS YOUR DESIGN.
        This is just a **hypothetical** example to illustrate the task.
        Let's say the design image in `IMAGE_PATH` looks like this:

        - At the very top of the page is a horizontal navigation bar with three items:  
        `Home | Projects | Contact`
        - These items are spaced evenly and centered horizontally at the top.
        - In the middle of the page (vertically centered), it says in large bold text:  
        `Veda D`

        This is a simple personal homepage layout. Your task is to generate HTML and CSS that creates this exact design.
